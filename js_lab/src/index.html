            <i>No single one can possess greater wisdom than the many Scholars who are elected by all men for their wisdom.
            Yet we can. We do. We have fought against saying it, but now it is said. We do not care.
            We forget all men, all laws and all things save our metals and our wires. So much is still to be learned!
            So long a road lies before us, and what care we if we must travel it alone!</i>
